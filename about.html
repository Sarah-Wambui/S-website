                    <p>My name is Sarah Wambui. I am a 26 year old woman from a small town called Elburgon in Nakuru County. Currently I am a student at Moringa school where I am pursuing a certificate in Software Engineering. I want to become proffesional programmer that is  why I decided to enroll in this course for the next five months. I am going to dedicate my time into coding and programming and also do research and study hard.  In Kenya right now tech industry is among the fastest growing industries and I am one to move with the trend. I aspire to be part of those great women in tech in Kenya mostly because this industry has been dominated by men for a very long period. I have a dream that in the near future I will start my own tech company to create job opportunities for youths in Kenya and help in the growth of our country's economy. </p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">My Education</h2>
            <p> I attended attended St. Peter and Paul for my primary school. It is a catholic school located in the interiors of Nakuru County. I studied hard and I managed to score 372/500 marks in my KCPE. This was good enough to land me into an all girls boarding high school called Gilgil Girls High School. This was a dream come tue because I had always desired to be in an all girls school to have a taste of what my friends used to experience. In here too, I did my best and in my KCSE, i managed to score an overall grade of B+. This was good enough to land me into a good university. Unfortunately, due to unavoidable circumstances I could not enroll for my higher education. Up and until last year I was just hustling then one of my relatives told me about Moringa School, their courses and their curriculumn that I decided to apply for a course in Software Engineering. I applied for a partial scholarshiip and they were kind enough to award me with one. So currently as I mentioned I am in Moringa School pursuing Software Engineering.</p>
